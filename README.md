# In tandem with my final project/manifesto, I asked ChatGPT-4 to create hole #2 at Cabot Cabe Breton (Cliffs) and describe it. I wanted to see if the result was similar to what the actual hole is like. The result is nothing like the real thing except that they are both golf holes.

# Here was my prompt: “Create an image of Cabot Cliffs hole #2 with a full description”

# “To create an image of Cabot Cliffs' Hole #2, we can imagine a stunning golf landscape. Picture a breathtaking view from the tee box of this par 3 hole, located along the rugged coast of Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia. The hole is positioned dramatically on a cliff edge, overlooking the Atlantic Ocean. The green is perched perilously close to the cliff's edge, with the ocean's waves crashing against the rocks below. The background features a clear blue sky, and the fairway is surrounded by natural, tall grasses that sway in the gentle sea breeze. Golfers on the green are visible in the distance, adding a human element to the scene. Let's proceed with creating this image. Here is the image of Cabot Cliffs' Hole #2, showcasing the dramatic coastal landscape and the golfing challenge it presents.”










# This is nothing like the real hole. The real one is a par 4, not directly on a cliff as seen in the following image: 

 

# As you can see, there are very few similarities. This was still an interesting exercise to do and proves that AI is not always accurate.
